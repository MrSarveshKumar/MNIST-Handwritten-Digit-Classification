# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Title: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using TensorFlow Keras and CNN

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Keras API to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks and serves as an excellent starting point for understanding deep learning concepts.

Overview:
The repository provides a step-by-step guide on creating, training, and evaluating a CNN model for digit classification, including explanations and code comments for each crucial component.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: The script includes code for downloading the MNIST dataset and preprocessing it for model training and evaluation. This includes data splitting, normalization, and one-hot encoding of labels.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The core of this project is the CNN architecture designed for digit classification. The model includes several convolutional and pooling layers to extract meaningful features from the input images. This architecture is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API for simplicity and readability.

Training: The script guides users through the training process, allowing them to customize hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. It also visualizes training progress and logs key performance metrics.

Evaluation: After training, the script evaluates the model's accuracy on a separate test dataset and provides a detailed report of the classification performance, including confusion matrices and classification reports.

Model Saving and Loading: Users can save the trained model to disk for future use and easily load it for inference on new images.

Inference: The repository includes a sample code snippet demonstrating how to use the trained model to classify new handwritten digits from custom images.
